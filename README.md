# Search

To search for something simply type it into the search bar and it will start searching automatically.

Multiple searches are possible if you separate the search strings with a space or japanese space.

## how does it work?
- Each element that is meant to be searched is assigned an id that corresponds to the entry or part of the entry.
- The ids are then being crawled through with a neat little Jquerry id search feature.
- Entries containing the search string will then be made visible.

All the logic is implemented in the front end.
